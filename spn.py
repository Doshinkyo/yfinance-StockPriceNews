# This script will ask it's user for a stock ticker symbol and return some stock price info and the most recent news stories (5 max) available from the yfinance Python module
# Aim is to revise this script so that the Unix Timestamp (providerPublishTime) is converted to a readable date in each news article printed out
# Script requires the Python installed and the yfinance module. The module can be installed by executing the command "pip install yfinance" from a terminal

# Change History
# v0.0.1 16th December 2021 Initial version of script to retrieve 5 news stories for a stock ticker
# v0.0.2 16th December 2021 Added stock price info
# v0.0.3 17th December 2021 Error handing for â€œIndexError" if fewer than 5 news stories are available. Moved stock price towards the top of the script output
# v0.0.4 17th December 2021 Added logic for more natural language on price change
# v0.0.5 20th December 2021 Achieved aim of making Unix TimeStamps readable and replaced keys from dictionary with formatted titles e.g. "title" became "Headline"
# v0.0.6 20th December 2021 Adedd error handling for invalid ticker entry and bespoke message for stocks with no news (untested feature).
